## Working with Chart Values
A Chart is mostly going to have some configurations coming with it, and these are called values in a Helm Chart.

- Showing value of a chart

```helm show values <given_label_name_for_repo_url/package_name_repo>```

- Upgrading a chart's default value. (After Chart's Installation)

```helm upgrade <given_label_name_for_chart> <given_label_name_for_repo_url/package_name_repo> --set <hierarchy_value.(if present)><key>=<value>```

- Upgrading a chart's default value. (During Chart's Installation)

```helm install <given_label_name_for_chart> <given_label_name_for_repo_url/package_name_repo> --set <hierarchy_value.(if present)><key>=<value>```
